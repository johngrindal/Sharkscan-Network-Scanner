Sharkscan is organized into methods that are defined in the main script, an individual method will be programmed (originally) in a seperate ruby script. This script will be organized into two parts, the "Requirements", and the "Body".

The "Requirements" are just the modules that must be required (just to test the script on its own). In the Requirements_example.rb file is and example of how a "REQUIREMENTS" file should look.

The "Body" section is where all of your code will go, it must begin with a #BODY tag and then you can add your code. After you have sumbitted it, I will look at the code and after it is formatted correctly place it into the main script, labeled sharkscan.rb

Hope you decide to Develop for and support this project!
